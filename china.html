 The world’s largest economy has embarked on an audacious effort to fill its factories with advanced manufacturing robots. The government of China hopes this will help the country retain its vast manufacturing industry as workers’ wages rise, and manufacturing becomes more efficient and technologically advanced around the world. The project will require robots that are significantly more advanced and cost-efficient, and the economic and technological ripples could be felt around the world.
hina is no stranger to technology-driven upheaval, of course, and it has already invested heavily in robot technology However, the scale of its new robot revolution will be remarkable. The province of Guangdong, the heartland of Chinese manufacturing, has already promised to invest $154 billion in installing robots. The founder of Foxconn, a company that employs vast armies of workers who make devices such as Apple’s iPhone, has said that his company will install more than a million robots in the next few years.
Expect to see signs that this bold endeavour is either working or faltering, and clues to what it might mean for the rest of the world, in the coming year.
